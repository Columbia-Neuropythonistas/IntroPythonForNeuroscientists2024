# Object-Oriented Programming + A Gentle Introduction To Machine Learning

This week, we're going to continue to go delve into the wonders (yeah, not really) of Object-Oriented Programming in Python.

Please download the `PfN_Week8_OOP+Data_STUDENT.ipynb` notebook, as well as `recording.npy` and place them in the same folder.


## Homework this week (e.g. for Week 9)

Please put together a class that:
1) Takes in as an arguments to the constructor:
   - A date
   - A path to data to be loaded
   - An experimenter name
2) This class should load in data from `recording.npy` (hint: the path should be to this file) when it is called / when you create an object.
3) The class should have a function that plots some of that data. We suggest that you create a function that takes in a neuron number as an argument, and then plots a histogram or other plot of that neuron's data - but feel free to do whatever you'd like.
4) Finally, write a function to print out the date, path, and experimenter name.

Run the code for this class, and then submit the output to courseworks. Feel free to use any resources you'd like, and copy/paste what you need to from past lessons.
