# Week 2 -- Intro to Python Part 1

## Optional Video on Conda environments and Jupyter Notebook Intro

[Video linked here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCOINLVBVmM)
### Optional extra credit work:
1. Create and run a jupyter notebook, ensuring you have selected the “intropython” environment kernel

2. Create and run 3 cells, making sure none of them output errors:

i. markdown cell
```
# hello world
```

  ii. code cell 

      print(‘hello world’)

  iii. code cell 

      import numpy

3. Take a screenshot of the notebook after executing all the cells, showing that there are no output errors and that you have the correct environment kernel selected. **Include in your Week02 coursework assignment for extra credit.**



## Pre-Work
Like last week, if you run into issues please contact us before class. Please upload a screenshot of the problem you are running into to the relevant assignment on courseworks so we can help you debug.


### 0. Class 1 catch-up - fixing Git and getting Jupyter Notebooks to work
Apologies again for things not working in class. The first thing we need to do is set up our intropython folder through git such that we can push, or upload, our scripts and files to the remote repository we previously set up online. We had an issue in class because we used https instead of ssh to set up our git repo locally, on our computer. If you're curious about how these server protocols work, feel free to come chat with us before class, but for now this is outside the scope of the class.

To set up our folder to work with SSH, we first need to 



### 1. Download the IntroPython1.ipynb file from this repository folder (Week02).
Please save it in your intro2python folder.
### 2. Commit the  IntroPython1.ipynb to your own intro2python repository.
Feel free to do it via Visual Studio Code or via git. I won't put instructions here on the exact commands, so try to jog your memory (or revisit the slides)!
### 3. Take a screenshot of your intro2python repository with the IntroPython1.ipynb and upload it to the Courseworks Assignment.
